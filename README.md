# Ionic-app  
**Ionic** (https://ionicframework.com/) is an open source mobile UI toolkit for building modern, high quality **cross-platform** mobile apps from a single code base in React, Vue or **Angular**.

In short, create mobile app with Angular knowledge and use of Ionic components (https://ionicframework.com/docs/components). Components are behaving a bit differently depeding on which operating systems you're running them (ios vs android).
